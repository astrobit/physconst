1. The following steps apply only if you want the documentation (recommended).
  1. Run `latex` on `physconst.dtx` to create the `.pdf` file. e.g. `xelatex physconst.pdf`.
  1. Run `makeindex` to create the index, e.g. `makeindex -s gind.ist -o physconst.ind physconst.idx`.
  1. Run `makeindex` to create the change log, e.g. `makeindex -s gglo.ist -o physconst.gls physconst.glo`.
  1. Run `latex` on `physconst.dtx` to create the `.pdf` file with index and change log. e.g. `xelatex physconst.pdf`.
  1. Run `latex` on `physconst.dtx` to get the labels sorted out. e.g. `xelatex physconst.pdf`.
